# Third-Eye-for-Blind
Abstract:
Third eye for the blind is an innovation with the help of the multidiscipline subjects like
computer science, electronics engineering and health science which helps the blind people to
navigate with speed and confidence by detecting the nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic
waves and notify them with a buzzer sound or vibration. According to WHO 39 million people
are estimated as blinds worldwide. They are suffering a lot of hardships in their daily life. The
affected ones have been using the tradition white cane for many years which although being
effective, still has a lot of disadvantages. This will be a wearable technology for the blinds. One
of the main peculiarities of this device is that it will be affordable. The main controlling device
of the project is Arduino nano. This will be equipped with ultrasonic sensors, consisting of
module. Using the sensor, visually impaired can detect the objects around them and can travel
easily. When the sensor detects any object, it will notify the user by beep or vibration. Thus, this
is an automated device. Thus, this device will be of a great use for the blinds and help them travel
different places.
